            + " The applicants are interviewed one by one in random order.  A decision about each particular applicant is to be made immediately after the interview." 
            + " Once rejected, an applicant cannot be recalled. During the interview, the administrator gains information sufficient to rank the applicant among all applicants interviewed so far," 
            + "but is unaware of the quality of yet unseen applicants.  The question is about the optimal strategy (stopping rule) to maximize the probability of selecting the best applicant."
            + " If the decision can be deferred to the end, this can be solved by the simple maximum selection algorithm of tracking the running maximum (and who achieved it),"
            + "and selecting the overall maximum at the end.  The difficulty is that the decision must be made immediately."
