# Kepler Dating Calculator Website.

This website was my first attempt at calculating optimal stopping theory for an individaul and their dating life.  The website takes two inputs, age at which the user started dating and age at which the user would like to be married by, and outputs the difference multiplied by the optimal stopping theory rule of 37%.  

This website was written using HTML and styled uss Bootstrap/CSS.
